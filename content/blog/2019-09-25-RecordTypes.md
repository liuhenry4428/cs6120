# Record Types!
The goal was to design and implement record types (aka structs). We decided on immutable record types using a nominal type system. We initially planned to implement record type declaration, record type instantiation, and record type accessing, but later decided to additionally implement _with statements_ to improve usability.

### To declare a record type
    type <record type name>  = 
        {<field1 name> : <field1 type> ; <field2 name> : <field2 type> ; … };

Where
`type` is a new keyword
`<record type name>` is an identifier 
`<field# name>` is an identifier
`<field# type>` is a primitive type or previously declared record type

We decided on this format to mirror OCaml [record type declarations](https://v1.realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/records.html). However, unlike OCaml, we disallow recursive record types (i.e. a record type that may contain itself) as we do not have a notion of Null in Bril. We need a notion of Null because a recursive record field must eventually be Null as it cannot be cyclic (as there are not pointers in Bril either), and so it is important to be able to check whether such a field is Null before accessing it.

Also unlike OCaml, we decided to use nominal record types instead of structural ones because we thought it was clearer and adhered well to the existing precedents in Bril where everything is clearly typed.

### Nominal vs Structural Typing
One of the main design decisions was whether we wanted to use nominal or structural typing to typecheck records.

```
type Dog = {age: int; isAsleep: bool}
type Person = {class: int; dog: Dog}
v0: int = const 3;
v1: bool = const false;
Milo: Dog = record {age: v0; isAsleep: v1}
v2: int = const 4120;
AndrewMyers: Person = record {class: v2; dog: Milo}
```

When defining a nested record, it is required to first define the nested record and assign it to a variable. Then, you can define the outer record with the field initialized to the variable holding the nested record. When type-checking these nested records, we need to lookup the type of the outer record from our type environment, and step through the fields, one by one, comparing the signature with the type returned from the lookup of the initializing variable. 

Consider the case for checking the variable initializing a nested record, i.e. `Milo`. With nominal typing, if we expected a type, Dog, and we looked up the variable to have type ‘Dog’, we know this must have been previously typechecked when it was defined and added to our environment. Therefore it still must typecheck, due to immutability. This sort of _shallow type-checking_ falls out of nominal subtyping. 

Along with the ability to quickly verify any type, nominal subtyping allows us to reject a nested record's type if it does not match the signature’s record type name without recursive checks. In a structural typing world, the name of the type bound to the initializing variable is not enough to reject a type. If the declared type did not match, we would need to recursively check all of the fields of the value bound to our initializing variable, and compare these with the type signature recursively. This is much slower, and does not take advantage of the variable-save model to avoid recomputation.



### Instantiation
To instantiate a new record with a previously declared record type, we use the following format:

    <record instance name>  : <record type> = 
        record {<field1 name> : <field1 value>; <field2 name> : <field2 value>};
Where:
`<record instance name>` is an identifier
`<record type>` is a previous declared record type
`<record>` is new keyword
`<field# name>` is the field name used in the record type definition
`<field# value>` is an identifier for an existing variable matching the field type

We decided to introduce the `record` keyword to match the precedent of using `id` or `const` in front of an identifier or constant value. Note that the ordering of field name and value pairs do not matter, as long as they match with the definiton’s field names and types. We also only allow field values to be existing variables to match the semantics of current operations. The structure of this statement was designed to match record type declarations as much as possible. 


### Access
We use the dot operator to access a field of a record:

    <new record name> : <type> = <record> . <field>

Where:
`<new record name>` is a valid identifier that takes on the value of the indicated field
`<record>` is the name of an instance of a record with a field name `<field>` that has type `<type>`
Note that there is a space before and after the dot. This is strictly necessary as dot is a valid character for a variable name and we decided that it would be horrible for backwards compatibility if we changed variable naming rules.


We chose this format because using the dot operator to access fields is very common in modern programming languages.

### *With* Syntax
While immutable data structures allow you to more easily reason about how values flow through your program, these currently immutable records are cumbersome to change. 
For example, to change one field, you must recreate the entire record. While we do want a new record to be created, copying variables between two records is overly tedious. 
As such, we decided to implement a with syntax, similar to OCaml in which the user just needs to specify a record name as the base, and then the fields desired to be changed, along with the new value. This maintains immutability, without so much tedium.

We use the following syntax:

    <new record>: <record type> = 
        <old record> with {<field1 name>: <field1 value>; <field2 name>: <field2 value> … };

Where:
`<new record>` is the name of the new record
`<record type>` is the same type as `<old record>`
`with` is a new keyword
`<field# name>` must match with a field in `<type>`
`<field# value>` must be a variable with a type that matches its field name.
Within the braces, the user may specify 0 to n field name and value pairs, where n is the total number of fields in the record type.

This syntax was designed to have a similar format as record instantiation. 

### Immutability
Immutable data structures are easier to reason about when developing compiler optimizations. However, forcing developers to recreate the entire record every time they need to change a value poses usability challenges. We decided on sticking to immutability in part for optimizations' sake. The ability to make guarantees that a value will not change lends itself well to constant-folding, even after a function call that takes in your record as an argument. 

### Evaluation
We set out to implement record types and we successfully implemented immutable nominal record types. Record types do not have any restrictions except that two fields cannot have the same name and that a record type cannot be recursive. Besides that, everything is allowed. Record types play nicely with existing types and new syntactical additions follow previous precedents set by Bril or otherwise follow precedents set by other languages that have record types. Record declaration, instantiation, and access are all (we think) intuitive and straightforward, and this means our record types provide good value as an addition to the Bril language. 

We found that creating new records was a tedious process if the record was large, so we implemented *with* statements in addition to the features mentioned above for situations where one wanted to duplicate a record with a few changes. It should be noted that it is bad form to use a with statement with no fields because that would be identical to referencing the old record with `… = id oldRecordName.`

We were successful in this aspect as creating a new record from an existing one but changing one field is nearly the same amount of code as mutating directly.
```
type Person = {age: int; isAsleep: bool}
v0: int = const 21;
v1: bool = const false;
Henry: Person = record {age: v0; isAsleep: v1}
v2: bool = const true;
AwakeHenry: Person = Henry with {isAsleep: v2}
```
Possible Mutable Record Syntax:
```
type Person = {age: int; isHappy: bool}
v0: int = const 21;
v1: bool = const false;
Henry: Person = record {age: v0; isHappy: v1}
v2: bool = const true;
Henry.isHappy = v2
```


### Notable Challenges
The design of records type went through multiple iterations before we were able to arrive at a specification that we felt was well-defined.
When making these decisions, one of the primary tradeoffs we identified was usability and ability to optimize.

We wanted records to be easy to use to store data, but with immutability to be able to better reason about what values variables could be at any point in our program. In addition, since these are value types, changing one field will only change the field of the copy of the record you are modifying. Therefore, the same functionality can be achieved, but in a safer way, with _with syntax_. These sort of design decisions and consideration of use cases was a challenge as we looked at other prior art to get ideas, but ultimately wanted these types to be useful in Bril. 

A different challenge of this project was probably debugging the typescript interpreter as it was very difficult to trace errors as the source typescript gets compiled into a separate javascript file. Debugging the parser in briltxt was not too bad as the new statement formats were pretty straightforward and we did not have to modify existing semantics.
